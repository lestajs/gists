# Gists LestaJS
This repository acts as a central platform for sharing LestaJS code snippets, examples, and extensions, promoting community development and easier knowledge sharing.

🌐 Project Website: https://gists.lesta.dev/

## How to Submit a Gist
1. Create a gist at [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com) using this description format:
"Short summary. #lestajs #your_tag #another_tag"
2. Include files with meaningful names.
3. Add full details in the first 💬 comment (optional but recommended).

## Reporting/Blacklisting Gists
To exclude spam or low-quality content:
1. Open 📄`blacklist.csv` in GitHub’s interface.
2. Add gist IDs, one per line.
3. Explain the reason in the commit message (e.g., "Added a1b2c3d4e5: spam" or "Added x9y8z7w6v5: ").
4. Click ✅ Commit changes — the gist will be excluded on the next workflow run.
